            The rivers of India play an important role in the lives of the people. They provide potable water, cheap
            transportation, electricity, and the livelihood for many people nationwide. This easily explains why nearly
            all
            the major cities of India are located by the banks of rivers. The rivers also have an important role in
            Hindu
            Religion and are considered holy by all Hindus in the country.[1]

            Seven major rivers along with their numerous tributaries make up the river system of India. The largest
            basin
            system of the rivers pour their waters into the Bay of Bengal; however, some of the rivers whose courses
            take
            them through the western part of the country and towards the east of the state of Himachal Pradesh empty
            into
            the Arabian Sea. Parts of Ladakh, northern parts of the Aravalli range and the arid parts of the Thar Desert
            have inland drainage.

            All major rivers of India originate from one of the following main watersheds.</p>
